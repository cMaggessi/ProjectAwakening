Project Awakening RPG is inspired by Solo Levelling RPG mechanics, where players can:
- Train to get levels (Sit ups, push ups, run, jump)
- Spend attribute points to get stronger (Agility, Strength, Mind, Endurance)
- Kill strong foes to get gold
- Buy new weapons and armor with said gold
- Become even more stronger
- Prestige system(???)


There is still a lot to do.


But for now I've made a admin menu system that can track the player's health, level, teleports to random location and teleport to player.


TODO next:
- First prototype
- Persistent leveling (Saves player's data like levels, how many mobs they killed and etc..)
- First prototype of achievement's rewards

TODO Future:
- Shopping system

Far TODO:
- Quest system
- As the players get away from spawn the mobs get stronger (Encouraging the mechanics of becoming stronger and buying more items)
