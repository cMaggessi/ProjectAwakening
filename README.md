## **TODO: Next Steps**

### **Short-Term Goals (IN PROGRESS)**
1. **Leveling Prototype**:
    - Introducing more stats:
        - **Mind**: Enables powerful abilities. [For now it won't do nothing.]
        - **Endurance**: Enhances health and defense.
        - **Prospection**: Drops more ores (Will be a grindy stat for balancing.) [New stat idea, still WIP]
2. **Attributes** 
   - Each attribute will give bonus to players: 
     - **Strength**: Will give players more damage.
     - **Agility**: Will make players run faster, swim faster, and swing pickaxes faster
     - **Endurance**: Increase player's health and armor points.
     - **Prospection**: Increases drop ore rate by 0.05%
     - **Mind**: For now it will do nothing.
